# Immediate:
- Garden Pond water shader not visible in edit mode unless you change one of the object's settings

# Later:
- Add doors to cathedral, only open once garden puzzle is solved (garden puzzle teaches players how the puzzles work)

# Undecided:
- How to make cathedral puzzle require player to stand at lectern?
- Add separate floor geometry so the masking materials look better?

# Don't know how to do this:
- Have EndCamera rotate so that the final camera pan works correctly
