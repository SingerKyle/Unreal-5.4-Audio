# Description

This project was created as a base for anyone wanting to explore audio implementation in Unreal. It includes no audio itself, but it does include a number of elements that require specific attention from game audio implementers. I currently use it in labs for my **CMP407: Audio Programming** module at [Abertay University](https://www.abertay.ac.uk/).

Developed in **Unreal 5.4.3**

Note that the 'puzzles' are not particularly challenging. This will hopefully change in future, see the [ToDo list](https://github.com/NiallMoody/UnrealAudioBase/blob/main/ToDo.md).

# Audio-relevant features

As it is intended as a base for audio implementation, the project includes the following features:

- Different surfaces to walk on/in (concrete, grass, water)
- Different shapes and sizes of enclosed spaces (with expectations of their own acoustic characteristics, i.e. reverb)
- Unreal's default third-person model, for timeline-based footstep triggering
- A small variety of buttons and event triggers
- A small pool of water for experimenting with underwater audio effects

# Additional notes about the project
As it's a third-person game, most materials make use of a masking shader that will cut out geometry around the player character so that the player has a clearer view of the level.

This makes it a little difficult to edit the level/geometry in the editor, so it is disabled (`0.0`) by default. It can be enabled (`1.0`) via the **MPC_Masking_Toggle** Material Parameter Collection:

# Locations of audio events

Locations for where to find and set the various audio events are listed in the table below.

Where **Location** is set to **Content:** this indicates the event is set on an asset from your Content Browser. Double-click the asset to edit it, then set the sound via the listed **Components Pane** and **Details Pane** values.

Where **Location** is set to **Outliner:** this indicates the event is set from an object in the scene. Select that object in the Outliner, and set the sound via its **Details Pane**.
